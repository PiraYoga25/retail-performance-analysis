# retail-performance-analysis
SQL &amp; Power BI retail performance analysis project

Objective:
To analyse a retail transactional dataset to understand revenue trends, profitability drivers, and customer behaviour.


Dataset Overview:

~10,000 transaction rows

Time range: 2015–2018

Key fields: order_id, order_date, customer_id, category, sales, profit


SQL Analysis Performed:

Data quality validation

Revenue by month

Order volume & Average Order Value

Category performance comparison

Customer segmentation (one-time vs repeat)

Profit margin analysis by category


Key Insights:

99.78% of revenue driven by repeat customers

Furniture generates high revenue but low margin (~2.5%)

Technology & Office Supplies maintain strong margins (~17%)

Growth appears volume-driven rather than pricing-driven


Next Steps:

Investigate Furniture discount trends

Break down sub-category margin performance

Analyse seasonality in greater detail
